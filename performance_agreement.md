# Performance

## Individual Objectives
### 1. Contribute to build an Open [SDI][1] for the ISM-DataCentre
  A spatial data infrastructure (SDI) is a framework of geographic data, metadata, users and tools that are interactively connected in order to use spatial data in an efficient and flexible way.   
  **date:**  December 2018
#### Deliverables
  1. Implement a GeoSpacial infrastructure based on [FOOS][5] to be acceded locally (SAERI and other Institutions)
  - Set and maintain a Linux server (VM) to host the IMS services
  - Implement a WebMapping platform to share the ISM datasets
  - Implement a Data discovery mechanism based on the IMS metadata catalogues (GeoServer)
  - Implement an [API][6] (Mapserver, QGIS-Server) to interact in a secure way with the IMS databases (PostgreSQL+PostGIS)
  - GIS Training program

### 2. Contribute to [OpenSource][0] the ISM-DataCentre
  OpenSource not only refers to computer software, including as well data and standards  
  **date:**  December 2018
#### Deliverables
  1. Introduce FOOS4G (PostgreSQL+PostGIS, Mapserver, QGIS-Server, GeoServer)
  - Implement OGC standards for the IMS services
  - Work in an Open Licence based on [Creative Commons][4] for the IMS-DataCentre
  - Add attribution line to IMS's deliverables (maps, datasets, images...)
  - Contribute to build community with the IMS's users and stablish links with other global communities such as OpenStreetMap, OSGeo, OKF...
